# Plain Language Guide for DigniFi

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** January 4, 2026  
**Target Reading Level:** 6th-8th grade (Flesch-Kincaid)

---

## I. Why Plain Language Matters

### The Literacy Reality

**U.S. Adult Literacy Statistics:**
- 54% of adults read below 6th-grade level
- 21% are functionally illiterate (below 5th grade)
- Legal documents average 12th-16th grade reading level

**DigniFi's users:**
- Are in crisis (cognitive load already high)
- May have lower educational attainment (poverty correlation)
- May speak English as second language
- Are intimidated by legal jargon

**Our responsibility:** Make bankruptcy accessible to everyone, not just college graduates.

---

## II. Core Principles

### 1. Use Common Words

**Replace legal jargon with everyday language:**

| Legal Term | Plain Language |
|------------|----------------|
| Petition | Filing, forms |
| Debtor | Person filing for bankruptcy, you |
| Creditor | Company you owe, lender |
| Discharge | Cancel, eliminate (debts) |
| Exemption | Protection (for property) |
| Trustee | Court representative, court officer |
| Means test | Income test, income limit |
| Current Monthly Income (CMI) | Average monthly income |
| Presumption of abuse | Income limit rule |
| Real property | Home, land, real estate |
| Personal property | Belongings, personal items |
| Secured debt | Loan with collateral (car, house) |
| Unsecured debt | Loan without collateral (credit card, medical) |
| Schedule A/B | Property list |
| Schedule I | Income form |
| Schedule J | Expense form |

### 2. Use Short Sentences

**Target:** 15-20 words per sentence maximum

❌ **Too Complex (35 words):**
```
The means test, which is required under 11 U.S.C. § 707(b), determines
whether your current monthly income, when compared to the median income
for your household size in your state, qualifies you for Chapter 7 relief.
```

✅ **Plain Language (3 sentences, ~12 words each):**
```
The means test compares your income to the state average.
If your income is below average, you typically qualify for Chapter 7.
This is required by federal bankruptcy law.
```

### 3. Use Active Voice

**Active voice:** Subject performs the action (clearer, more direct)  
**Passive voice:** Subject receives the action (vague, bureaucratic)

| Passive (❌) | Active (✅) |
|-------------|-----------|
| "Forms must be filed by the debtor" | "You must file these forms" |
| "Income information is required" | "We need your income information" |
| "Exemptions are determined by state law" | "State law sets which property is protected" |
| "The stay is imposed automatically" | "The court automatically stops creditor calls" |

### 4. Define Terms on First Use

**Pattern:** Plain language first, then technical term in parentheses.

**Example:**
```
Chapter 7 eliminates (discharges) most unsecured debts.
Unsecured debts are loans without collateral, like credit cards
and medical bills.
```

**When to define:**
- First use in a section
- Any term not in common use
- Legal terms required for forms (use both terms)

### 5. Use Concrete Examples

**Abstract concepts are hard to understand. Give examples.**

❌ **Abstract:**
```
The automatic stay prohibits most collection actions.
```

✅ **Concrete:**
```
Once you file, creditors must stop:
• Phone calls demanding payment
• Wage garnishment
• Lawsuits
• Repossession (in most cases)

This is called the "automatic stay."
```

## III. Writing Formulas

### Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level

**Target:** 6.0-8.0 (6th to 8th grade)

**Formula:**
```
0.39 × (words/sentences) + 11.8 × (syllables/words) - 15.59
```

**How to achieve:**
- Average 15 words per sentence
- Use 1-2 syllable words (75%+ of the time)

**Tools:**
- Hemingway Editor (free, hemingwayapp.com)
- Microsoft Word (Review → Readability Statistics)
- Grammarly (premium feature)

### Flesch Reading Ease

**Target:** 60-70 (Plain English, easily understood by 13-15 year olds)

**Formula:**
```
206.835 - 1.015 × (words/sentences) - 84.6 × (syllables/words)
```

**Score interpretation:**
- 90-100: Very Easy (5th grade)
- 60-70: Plain English (8th-9th grade) ← **DigniFi target**
- 30-50: Difficult (college)
- 0-30: Very Difficult (college graduate)

## IV. Structure & Formatting

### Use Headings & Lists

**People scan, they don't read.** Structure content for scanning.

❌ **Wall of Text:**
```
To file for bankruptcy you need to gather several documents including
your pay stubs from the last six months, your bank statements from the
last two months, a list of all your creditors with their addresses and
account numbers, recent bills for mortgage or rent, utilities, car
payments, and insurance, and any legal documents like divorce decrees
or child support orders.
```

✅ **Scannable List:**
```
Documents You'll Need

To file for bankruptcy, gather:
• Last 6 months of pay stubs
• Last 2 months of bank statements
• List of creditors (who you owe)
• Recent bills: mortgage, car, utilities
• Legal documents: divorce, child support
```

### Use White Space

**Dense text is overwhelming.**

**Guidelines:**
- One idea per paragraph
- Blank line between paragraphs
- Generous margins (20-40px)
- Bullet points for lists (not dense paragraphs)

### Use Visual Hierarchy

**Size, weight, and spacing signal importance.**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Chapter 7 Bankruptcy                            │ ← H1 (largest)
│                                                 │
│ What It Does                                    │ ← H2
│                                                 │
│ Chapter 7 eliminates most unsecured debts.      │ ← Body
│                                                 │
│ Common Debts Eliminated:                        │ ← H3
│ • Credit cards                                  │ ← List
│ • Medical bills                                 │
│ • Personal loans                                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## VI. Writing Patterns for Common Scenarios

### Explaining Legal Requirements

**Pattern:**
1. State the rule in plain language
2. Explain why it exists (briefly)
3. Give concrete example

**Example (Means Test):**

```
The Means Test

The means test compares your income to the state average.
[Plain statement]

Why it exists: Bankruptcy law tries to ensure Chapter 7 is for
people who truly can't afford to repay debts.
[Brief explanation]

How it works: We calculate your average monthly income from the
last 6 months. If it's below $4,200 (for a single person in Illinois),
you typically qualify.
[Concrete numbers]
```

### Explaining Forms

**Pattern:**
1. Form name (official + plain)
2. What it asks for
3. Why it's required
4. How long it takes

**Example (Schedule I):**

```
Schedule I: Your Income

What it is: Form listing all your income sources.

What we'll ask:
• Your job and salary
• Spouse's income (if married)
• Other income (Social Security, unemployment, child support)

Why it's required: The court needs to verify your income to
determine which debts can be eliminated.

Time to complete: About 10 minutes
```

### Error Messages

**Pattern:**
1. Describe what's wrong (no blame)
2. Explain what's needed
3. Offer help

**Example:**

❌ **Harsh:**
```
Invalid date format. Correct your entry.
```

✅ **Plain & Helpful:**
```
Date format needed: MM/DD/YYYY

Example: 01/15/2025 for January 15, 2025

## VII. Testing Readability

### Manual Check (5-Second Rule)

**Test:** Show a paragraph to someone unfamiliar with bankruptcy.
- Can they repeat the main idea in 5 seconds?
- If no → too complex; simplify.

### Automated Tools

**Hemingway Editor (hemingwayapp.com):**
- Highlights complex sentences (yellow = hard, red = very hard)
- Shows grade level
- Suggests simpler alternatives
- **Target:** Grade 6-8, mostly green/yellow

**Microsoft Word:**
1. File → Options → Proofing
2. Check "Show readability statistics"
3. Run spell check
4. Review Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level

**Grammarly:**
- Premium feature shows readability score
- Suggests simpler word choices

### User Testing

**Best test:** Watch real users read your content.
- Do they pause or reread?
- Do they ask "What does this mean?"
- Do they skip sections?

**Fix:**
- Pauses/rereads → too complex
- Questions → define terms
- Skipping → too dense; add headings/lists

## VIII. Before/After Examples

### Example 1: Means Test Results

❌ **Before (Grade 14):**
```
Based on the calculation of your Current Monthly Income pursuant
to 11 U.S.C. § 707(b)(2)(A)(ii), your annualized CMI of $38,400
is below the applicable median family income threshold of $50,960
for a household of two persons in the Northern District of Illinois,
thereby establishing a presumption that granting relief under
Chapter 7 would not constitute an abuse under § 707(b)(2).
```

✅ **After (Grade 7):**
```
Means Test Result: You May Qualify

Your average monthly income: $3,200
State median for 2-person household: $4,247

Your income is below the median.

What this means: You may be eligible to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
Chapter 7 eliminates most debts in 3-4 months without a repayment plan.

Next step: Continue to the Special Circumstances review.
```

### Example 2: Special Circumstances Prompt

❌ **Before (Grade 13):**
```
Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 707(b)(2)(B), debtors may rebut the
presumption of abuse by demonstrating special circumstances that
justify additional expenses or adjustments to current monthly income.
```

✅ **After (Grade 6):**
```
Special Circumstances

Have you experienced any recent hardships that affect your finances?

Examples:
• Lost your job or had hours reduced
• Serious medical condition or injury
• Separation or divorce
• Caring for a family member with a disability

Why we ask: These circumstances can help you qualify for bankruptcy
even if your income seems too high.

[Yes, I have special circumstances] [No, I don't]
```

### Example 3: Fee Waiver Explanation

❌ **Before (Grade 12):**
```
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1930(f), individuals whose household income
is less than 150% of the federal poverty guideline may apply for a
waiver of the filing fee.
```

✅ **After (Grade 7):**
```
Filing Fee Waiver

The bankruptcy filing fee is $338.

You may qualify for a fee waiver if your household income is below
150% of the poverty line. For a single person, that's about $2,200/month.

Good news: Based on your income, you may qualify for a fee waiver.
We'll help you request it when you file.
```
